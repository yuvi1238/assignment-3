In this assignment i have two codes :

(1) Factorial of a number => this code will ask a input from user and give factorial of that number , in this we have a function which will give factorial , in function we used if else condition , in if, we set two condition that is if x is 0 or 1 then it will return 1, and in else we used our fucntion code i.e(x*factorial(x-1)) this works on recursion , the function will call it self again and again until it reaches 1, for example if we inter 5 then it will multiply 5 with the factorial 4 , and for factorial 4 it will multiply 4 with factorial 3 and so on until it reaches 1, and outside of this function i have set another if else condition, where if x<0 then it will print invalid , and in else the function will work as we need it to work.

(2) import math=> in this code i have import the math module , we will as an input from user and then it will square root p(rint (math.squrt()), log base e(math.log()) and sine (math.sin())
